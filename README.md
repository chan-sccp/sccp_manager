This module has been developed to help IT Staff with their Asterisk-Cisco infrastructure deployment,
providing easily provisioning and managing Cisco IP phones and extensions in a similar way as it does with Cisco CallManager.
The idea of creating a module is borrowed from (https://github.com/Cynjut/SCCP_Manager)
SCCP Manager is free software. Please see the file COPYING for details.

This module will suit you if you are planing the to migrate from CallManager to Asterisk (or did it), SCCP-Manager allows you to administer SCCP extensions and a wide range of Cisco phone types (including IP Communicator).
You can control phone buttons (depending on the phone model) assigning multiple lines, speeddials and BLFâ€™s.
And you can use the driver functions "sccp_chain" from the GUI module.

### IMPORTANT NOTES:
- !!! If something stops working, use the master branch [master](https://github.com/PhantomVl/sccp_manager/tree/master)
  !!! master branch does not support changes into chan-sccp made after October 2018.
- This system assumes/requires that you are using the Asterisk realtime database. If you are not yet using the realtime database,
you will have to set it up for this module to work ([See](https://github.com/chan-sccp/chan-sccp/wiki/Realtime-Configuration)).
- For the cisco phones to work correctly, they should be provisioned with the latest firmware (v8.1 or higher)
- You can use cisco language profiles (localization) to switch the phones to your locale.
