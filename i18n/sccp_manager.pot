msgid "You can also configure a Survivable Remote Site Telephony (SRST) reference as the last device in the CallManager(CM) list. This proves especially useful in a remote site configuration where the phones and Asterisk are connected over a WAN network. SRST provides users with fallback support for the IP phones that cannot access the primary, secondary, or tertiary Asterisk Node in the CallManager List because of an Asterisk Node failure or loss of connectivity across the WAN. For the remote sites attached to multiple-service routers across the WAN, SRST ensures that your remote users receive continuous (although minimal) service by providing call handling support directly from the SRST router."

#: views/server.model:
msgid "When IP phones lose contact with primary, secondary, and tertiary Asterisk Nodes (CM's), they must establish a connection to a local SRST router to sustain the call-processing capability necessary to place and receive calls. The IP phone retains the IP address of the local SRST router as a default router in the Network Configuration area of the Settings menu. The Settings menu supports a maximum of five default router entries; however, the cnf.xml accommodates a maximum of three entries. When a secondary Asterisk Node is not available on the network, the local SRST Router's IP address is retained as the standby connection for Asterisk Node during normal operation."
